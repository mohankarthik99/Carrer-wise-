swells beyond the 100 crore level or the one billion mark, there looms a sober spectacle of poverty and overcrowding. It would be quite depressing to dwell on these distressing aspects and even if one chooses the osterich stance with its heads buried in the sand, these alarming issues looming at the horizon just cannot be wished away. As harried parents goad their children into aspiring and planning for the IIT- IIM - IT educations, the seemingly rosy "Knowledge Era" perches tentalisingly in front of our very noses. There was a time when more than half of the households in Kerala had a wages earner in Gulf and the preety state was the envy of the rest of the country with their plump Gulf remittences. But now, the wheel of fortune has turned and Chennai( by virtue of of its U.S. Consulate catering to Bangalore and Hyderabad too) accounts for over 70 per cent of the coveted H1 visas ! The gold rush is well and truly on and with every first and second generation Indian string it rich in Silicon Valley, there are several thousand starry-eyed fresh hopefuls leaving the Indian shores for taking up, in most cases, data entry level positions in U.S. IT firms. For them, the immediate future represents a monthly saving of 1500 dollars which translates to around Rs. 7.5 lakhs a year after taxes. In the vast Indian scenario, more and more start-ups are prospering and most of thes companies are monitored by fund flushed NRIs keen to establish strongholds in their native land. The lure for these NRIs is the relatively lower pay-outs here than in Silicon Valley( but much much higher than Indian wages in the nineties)and the readymade supply of bright young computer savvy minds. This is where a unique Indian website comes in - certainly the first of its kind - Chennai's very own Careersindia.com has deputed with the most comprehensive offering everseen on oppurtunities in education both in India and abroad. If one logs in to the site(www.careersindia.com), the range of services , almost all of them free, jump out in tasteful and friendly pastel colours.
