                                As the countries ever burgeoning population swells beyond the 100 crore level or the one billion mark, there looms a sober
                                spectacle of poverty and overcrowding. It would be quite depressing to dwell on these distressing
                                aspects and even if one chooses the osterich stance with its heads buried in the sand, these
                                alarming issues looming at the horizon just cannot be wished away. As harried parents goad
                                their children into aspiring and planning for the IIT- IIM - IT educations, the seemingly
                                rosy "Knowledge Era" perches tentalisingly in front of our very noses. There was a time when
                                more than half of the households in Kerala had a wages earner in Gulf and the preety state
                                was the envy of the rest of the country with their plump Gulf remittences. But now, the wheel
                                of fortune has turned and Chennai( by virtue of of its U.S. Consulate catering to Bangalore
                                and Hyderabad too) accounts for over 70 per cent of the coveted H1 visas ! The gold rush
                                is well and truly on and with every first and second generation Indian string it rich in
                                Silicon Valley, there are several thousand starry-eyed fresh hopefuls leaving the Indian
                                shores for taking up, in most cases, data entry level positions in U.S. IT firms. For them,
                                the immediate future represents a monthly saving of 1500 dollars which translates to around
                                Rs. 7.5 lakhs a year after taxes. In the vast Indian scenario, more and more start-ups are
                                prospering and most of thes companies are monitored by fund flushed NRIs keen to establish
                                strongholds in their native land. The lure for these NRIs is the relatively lower pay-outs
                                here than in Silicon Valley( but much much higher than Indian wages in the nineties)and the
                                readymade supply of bright young computer savvy minds. This is where a unique Indian website
                                comes in - certainly the first of its kind - Chennai's very own Careersindia.com has deputed
                                with the most comprehensive offering everseen on oppurtunities in education both in India
                                and abroad. If one logs in to the site(www.careersindia.com), the range of services , almost
                                all of them free, jump out in tasteful and friendly pastel colours. The student can get details
                                of sectoral education covering the most popular vocations of the time, lists of institutions
                                offering the same, admission criteria , fees structure and even model question papers with
                                answers for entrance tests. For the teenager to discover his or her aptitude for a particular
                                vocation, Careersindia .com administers an on-line personality mapping technique. To highlight
                                the extensive services that Careersindia have on their web site - in addition to guiding
                                and enabling young minds to embark on an effective education, the hand-holding extends to

                                By Alaphia Zoyab. Are you a confused student wondering what you should do with your life? Are you a desperate job-seeker
                                with no idea how to handle an interview? Or are you just having that ‘mid-life crisis' everyone
                                talks about? Well, CareersIndia.Com Pvt. Ltd. is there to help, if not solve your problems.
                                "This is a new concept which has been started after conducting a thorough market survey,"
                                says R. Kannan, one of the directors. Kannan is an alumnus of XLRI Jamshedpur and has held
                                posts in firms like Blowplast, Cromptons and Hindustan Lever. The directors have also conducted
                                some career guidance programmes in schools and at Lions Club meetings. They found that the
                                response from parents and students was very positive. This prompted them to open a proper
                                career counseling firm. Their services are called ‘CareerCare' and consists of 4 products.
                                These are ‘Career Wise' for students which helps you to make a decision as far as choosing
                                a career is concerned. Another director, says, " The decision making process is very haphazard,
                                probably because of parental pressure, social pressure or even peer pressure. We help the
                                person to discover his innate personality through a series of tests and then provide him
                                with a report." ‘Career Match' is a product or a pre-qualification service offered by Careers
                                India to enterprises. It deploys its Assessment and Counseling tools to scientifically screen
                                and shortlist the candidates. ‘Career Smart' is for job-seekers, whom the company helps to
                                build a professional resume and conduct mock interviews to guide them through real life situations.
                                The directors believe that web-based job-hunting is going to grow quite phenomenally. "Our
                                web site will give enterprises a global audience and help individuals to address global opportunities,"
                                says Kannan. Recently, the company has associated itself with the US based Bigby Havis &
                                Associates Inc., Organizational Psychologists and Consultants. It also launched four more
                                products (Select, Assess, Salesmax and Career Scan) to meet specified organizational needs.
